                    <h1> Ogyen Trinley Dorje

                        <img src="img/17th-karmapa-image-2.jpg" alt="">   

                    </h1>                 

                    <p>   As the  Karmapa born in the late 20th century, it is the task of the  Seventeenth Karmapa to bring spiritual teachings nurtured in the mountain  
                        hermitages of Tibet  fully into the era of globalization, when those teachings are so urgently  needed. To do so, on June 19, 1985, 
                        the reincarnation lineage of the Karmapas  took form for the seventeenth time, with the birth of a young boy in Tibet.  </p> 

                    <p> As he  
                        had indicated in his previous life as the Sixteenth Gyalwang Karmapa, His  Holiness the Seventeenth Karmapa was born in eastern Tibet, 
                        to a mother named Lolaga and  a father named D&ouml;ndrup. For the first years of his childhood, the Gyalwang  Karmapa shared his 
                        family&rsquo;s simple nomadic life in a remote and rugged corner  of Tibet&rsquo;s  high plateau.&nbsp; </p> 

                    <p> When he was just seven  years old, 
                        a search party arrived at his family&rsquo;s camp. Following the detailed  instructions of the letter written by his previous incarnation, 
                        the Sixteenth  Karmapa, the party was able to locate the young Karmapa. The child&rsquo;s  identification as the Karmapa was verified not 
                        only by Tai Situ Rinpoche,  Goshir Gyaltsap Rinpoche and many other major Karma Kagyu lamas, but also by  His Holiness the Dalai Lama. </p> 

                    <p>
                        His Holiness returned with the search  party to Tsurphu Monastery in central Tibet, where he was enthroned and  given his initial monastic 
                        ordination. He thereafter commenced the process of  study and training traditional for Karmapas, yet began offering spiritual  instruction 
                        to others almost at once. His first public teaching, given at  Tsurphu in Tibet  when he was just eight years old, was attended by over 
                        20,000 people. However,  the major Karma Kagyu lineage holders were denied permission to enter Tibet to  transmit the essential instructions 
                        of the lineage to him, a situation that  constituted an insurmountable obstacle to his functioning fully as Karmapa in  the world. When the 
                        young Karmapa found his situation in Tibet intolerable, at the age of 14, he escaped  from Tibet to India, seeking  freedom to fulfill his 
                        role as a world spiritual leader and to meet his  responsibilities as head of the Karma Kagyu lineage.&nbsp; </p> 

                    <p>

                        Crossing the Himalayas by jeep and on  horseback, on foot and by helicopter, Gyalwang Karmapa reached Dharamsala, India,  on January 5, 2000.
                        There, he was received warmly by His Holiness the Dalai  Lama, with whom the Gyalwang Karmapa has since continued to enjoy a close  relationship 
                        of mentor and prot&eacute;g&eacute;. During the 11 years he has lived in India as a  refugee, the Gyalwang Karmapa has undergone a traditional 
                        monastic training and  philosophical education, while also pursuing a private modern education. His  Holiness receives tens of thousands of 
                        visitors each year from all over the  world at his residence in Dharamsala. Since 2004, he has led the Kagyu Monlam Chenno, an annual winter 
                        Dharma gathering in Bodhgaya that draws thousands of  attendees from many different Buddhist traditions around the world. </p> 
                    <p>                                               

                        In May 2008, His Holiness made his first  long-awaited trip to the West, travelling to the United   States where he visited many spiritual 
                        centers under his  guidance, including his North American seat in New York. In November 2009, His Holiness  spoke at a TED conference in 
                        Bangalore,  becoming the youngest person ever to do so. In January 2010 in Bodhgaya, 12,000  people attended the live performance of a play 
                        His Holiness wrote and produced  on the life of Milarepa, combining elements of traditional Tibetan opera and  modern theatre.

                        Along  with his efforts to preserve and present Tibetan culture, 
                        the Gyalwang Karmapa  has also travelled across India  to participate in the cultural and religious life of his adopted home. 
                        From  inaugurating temples for Sai Baba in Tamil Nadu to commemorating Mother  Teresa&rsquo;s 100th birthday in Calcutta,  
                        His Holiness has met with many other spiritual leaders in a spirit of mutual  respect and tolerance. His Holiness further 
                        serves as a Dharma teacher to the  Buddha Vikas Sangh and other communities of Indian Buddhists around the  country. </p> 

                    <p>
                        Out of reverence for the origins of Buddhism in India, His  Holiness introduced the use of Sanskrit prayers in the massive 
                        Kagyu Monlam  prayer gatherings he directs. His Holiness has also taken steps to revive lost  Indian Buddhist song traditions. 
                        After seeking out the original Sanskrit texts  of sacred songs (<em>doh&#257;</em>) from his Dharma lineage, the  Gyalwang Karmapa invited
                        Indian classical singers who performed at the opening  ceremony of the Karmapa 900 celebration in Bodhgaya in December, 2010. 
                        This  performance marked the first time the sacred Sanskrit song was performed in India in nearly  a millennium. </p> 

                    <p>
                        Two issues that His Holiness has  particularly championed are women&rsquo;s rights and environmental protection. 
                        He has  instituted numerous practical programs to care for the environment as a way of  caring for future generations, 
                        and has personally committed to ensuring that in  the future, women will have the opportunity to receive full ordination as nuns  
                        within the Tibetan Buddhist tradition.</p> 

                    <p>
                        In this way, the Seventeenth Karmapa acts  within a vast horizon of benefit, yet his forward-looking deeds remain deeply  
                        grounded in a respect for the past. As a scholar and meditation master, as well  as painter, poet, songwriter and playwright, 
                        the Seventeenth Karmapa embodies a  wide range of the activities that Karmapas have engaged in over the centuries.  
                        As an environmental activist and world spiritual leader whose teachings are  often webcast live, His Holiness is clearly bringing 
                        the Karmapa lineage&rsquo;s  activities fully into the 21st century. </p>
