                    <h1>The previous KARMAPAs</h1>
                    <h2><u>1. The First Karmapa, Dusum Khyenpa 1110-1193</u></h2>
                    <p><img src="img/previous-karmapas-2.jpg" alt="" >Nine  hundred years ago, in 1110 CE, amidst the snow-capped peaks of eastern Tibet, there was born a spiritual master whose  compassion for beings would shape the future of Buddhism in Tibet. This great master was the  First Karmapa, Dusum Khyenpa, who instituted the practice of intentional  reincarnation in a way that disciples could recognize&mdash;a practice that forms the  backbone of Tibetan Buddhism as we know it today. </P>
                    <p>
                        Buddhism teaches that the sole aim of  buddhas and bodhisattvas is to guide others to enlightenment. Since the time of  the Buddha, countless bodhisattvas have perfected their training in compassion  and skillful means and cared for their disciples wholeheartedly, yet at the  moment of passing away have had to leave the ongoing care of those disciples to  others. </p>
                    <p>                
                        However, once such great beings have reached a certain level of  spiritual attainment, they have the ability to remain aware through the death  process and consciously choose their next place of birth. This ability makes it  possible for them to indicate the place of their next rebirth before they pass  away, so that they can be clearly identified and thus resume the guidance of  their students and their broader work in the world. This is the meaning of the  term &ldquo;reincarnate lama.&rdquo; Tibetan reincarnate lamas such as His Holiness the  Dalai Lama and the Gyalwang Karmapa have engaged in this practice for over a  dozen lives already. Yet for the first 15 centuries of the Buddhadharma, no  master conceived of this ideal means of caring for their disciples life after  life&mdash;until Dusum Khyenpa, with his extraordinarily creative means and his  intense commitment to his students&rsquo; well-being and the continuity of the  teachings entrusted to him. </P>
                    <p>
                        The totality with which Dusum Khyenpa  embraced his responsibility as a spiritual guide to others was evident both in  his deeds and his speech. On one occasion, Dusum Khyenpa and his fellow  students had received a teaching by their lama Dagpo Rinpoche, or Lord Gampopa,  in which he had identified great compassion as one of the indispensable  qualities of a spiritual teacher. As the Dharma friends sat discussing this  comment, Dusum Khyenpa offered his understanding of what this implied. As a  spiritual teacher, Dusum Khyenpa said, even if one had to go to a hell realm  oneself for the sake of a disciple, one would do so willingly, but under no circumstances  would one abandon one&rsquo;s disciples.</p>
                    <p>    
                        Dusum Khyenpa has fully lived up to his  own definition of a spiritual guide to beings. Indeed, he has proven himself  unwilling to abandon his students, even at the moment of death. After he passed  away in 1193, Dusum Khyenpa intentionally returned as the Second Karmapa, Karma  Pakshi, and made it utterly clear that he was, in fact, the reincarnation of  the First Karmapa. Since then, he has taken an uninterrupted series of rebirths  as the Karmapa, returning again and again for more than 900 years to engage in  a vast array of activities to benefit beings and the Buddhadharma. 
                    </p>

                    <p> 
                        <img src="img/previous-karmapas-4.jpg" alt="">Dusum  Khyenpa was the first in Buddhist history to leave indications where he would  be reborn so that his disciples could search for his reincarnation. He was also  the first to identify himself to previous followers after he was reborn.&nbsp; But he was by no means the last. Indeed,  Tibetan Buddhism today would be vastly different without the reincarnation lineages  of the many great masters who adopted this practice as a highly effective means  of accomplishing a variety of beneficial aims. </p>
                    <p> 
                        Intentionally reincarnating in a form  that disciples can recognize allows lamas to maintain long-term, multi-life  relationships with their disciples. Although with each new birth, the lama must  pass through the natural stages of physical development, they begin that  process with a mental maturity far beyond their physical years. This allows  them to quickly take up their role as a spiritual guide to their students from  the previous life. By resuming relationships with such disciples, they  guarantee that they are returning to the situation in which they have the  strongest possible karmic and social basis to be of benefit to others. At the  same time, they may continue any wider projects initiated in their previous  lives, such as developing their monastic establishments, study institutes or  retreat centers and attend to the overall transmission of the teaching lineage  under their care.</p>
                    <p> 
                        The unparalleled longevity of Buddhist  institutions in Tibet  is due in no small part to the remarkable resilience of such reincarnation  lineages. Over the centuries, Tibetan Buddhism has survived wild fluctuations  in political, military and economic conditions. In the 20th century, it managed  to reconstitute itself in exile, bereft of all the material conditions that  earlier sustained it in its native ground. Human beings have the capacity to  adapt far more quickly than large institutions, and each new master in a  reincarnation lineage may apply their wisdom and flexibility in response to  changing historical circumstances, without losing the over-riding sense of  purpose and direction that defines their lineage, and that led them to  reincarnate in the first place. In this way, the institution of reincarnation  has played a great part in allowing Tibetans to transmit the teachings brought  from India over a millennium  ago in unbroken lineages, and to cross back to India with that Dharma still a  vitally relevant tradition.</p>
                    <p>
                        What now seems so obvious a way to care  for disciples and lineage over generations was not only not obvious in Dusum  Khyenpa&rsquo;s time: it was unheard of. In order to fully comprehend who the First  Karmapa was, one would need to imagine so great a yearning for the wellbeing of  the world, so firm a commitment to accomplish it himself, and so creative a  thinker that he found a previously unimagined means of doing so. </p>

                    <h2>The Life of Dusum Khyenpa</h2>
                    <p>Dusum Khyenpa was born in eastern Tibet  in the year 1110 CE, to a mother named Lhathok Zagang Jam and a father named  Gompa Dorje G&ouml;npo. His birthplace lies in Dresh&ouml;, a part of Dreho, Kham, ringed  by snow-covered mountains. Unlike those who preceded him in the Marpa Kagyu  lineage, Dusum Khyenpa was born to a humble family with greater aptitude for spiritual  practice than worldly success. Both his parents were active practitioners, and  the name given him as a child was Gephel, meaning Virtue Increases. His parents  sought to ensure that he lived up to his name by teaching him the Dharma as an  integral part of his upbringing from the very start. His father&rsquo;s main practice  was Yam&#257;ntaka and his mother was described as a natural yogin&#299;. Raised in such  an environment, Dusum Khyenpa was steeped in the Dharma from birth. At the age  of 11, he received initiation and instruction in the practice of Palden Lhamo  from his father and Sherab G&ouml;n, a family relative and serious practitioner. In  a hint of the attainments to come later in his life, while he was engaging in  the practice, Dusum Khyenpa had a direct vision of Palden Lhamo.</p>
                    <h3>His Difficult  Adolescence</h3>
                    <p>
                        Although his childhood years helped  prepare the young Dusum Khyenpa for the Dharma activities at which he would  excel later in life, nothing could prepare him for the emotional storms that  would arise in his adolescence. This series of events in his life is usually  omitted from his biographies, or referred to only cryptically, or perhaps  euphemistically, as &ldquo;subduing his enemy.&rdquo; A fuller version of this &ldquo;subduing&rdquo;  appears in the biography of Dusum Khyenpa compiled by the Eighth Karmapa, Miky&ouml;  Dorje. That account indicates that Dusum Khyenpa underwent a period of great  inner turmoil during his teenage years. In an age-old scenario that is no less  painful because it is so common, Dusum Khyenpa lost the young woman with whom  he was romantically involved to another man. The woman was &ldquo;stolen away&rdquo; from  him by the rival, as the biography puts it. Dusum Khyenpa&rsquo;s response showed  every sign of jealous rage, for he sought out a means to kill the man. Using  the black arts of sorcery that Milarepa had likewise deployed, Dusum Khyenpa  managed to accomplish his aim, and the man died. Shortly thereafter, Dusum  Khyenpa left the householder&rsquo;s life behind once and for all, to take monastic  ordination at the age of 16.</p>
                    <p>
                        Although his biography does not detail  Dusum Khyenpa&rsquo;s internal state during this time, the incident indicates that  Dusum Khyenpa was caught in the grip of overwhelming attachment and the  uncontrolled anger that so often arises when one is deprived of an object of strong  attachment. However, the fact that he opted to ordain after this episode  suggests that the experience awakened in him a deep sense of the futility of  spending a life in pursuit of such objects of attachment. His direct experience  of the destructive force of his own afflictive emotions surely served as a  powerful empirical proof of the truth of the Buddha&rsquo;s teachings that the causes  of suffering lie within, and that the causes of happiness lie there as well.</p>
                    <p>
                        With the certainty born of this harsh  encounter with the suffering caused by his own afflictions, Dusum Khyenpa left  behind the life of mundane pursuits once and for all, to enter the door of the  Dharma. He was ordained as a novice monk by Dreho Chogi Lama (b. 1056), a  70-year old disciple of the great Tibetan translator Ngog Lots&#257;wa Loden Sherab  (1059-1109). Upon receiving his monastic vows, Dusum Khyenpa had a vision that  the Buddha presented him with a black hat. He later fashioned a physical hat  modeled on the one in his vision, and this became the first material hat  associated with the Karmapa line. At this time, he was given his epithet  &ldquo;Karmapa,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Being of Enlightened Activity,&rdquo; as a secret name. </p>
                    <h3>In Quest of Dharma </h3>
                    <p>
                        Within three years of his ordination,  Dusum Khyenpa was on his way to central Tibet, to the preeminent sites for  rigorous scholarly study as well as meditative practice. Unbeknownst to him, at  the same time a fellow Khampa named Phagdru Dorje Gyalpo, or Phagmodrupa  (1110-1170), was also making the long journey from Kham to central Tibet  in quest of the Dharma. Born in the same year, the two later met far from home,  in the major study centers of the day in T&ouml;lung in central Tibet. They became close Dharma  friends, and both later entrusted themselves to Gampopa for spiritual guidance.  In time, Dusum Khyenpa and Phagmodrupa would prove to be most instrumental in  safeguarding the future of Gampopa&rsquo;s lineage. It was Dusum Khyenpa who founded  the Karma Kagyu and Phagmodrupa who trained disciples who later founded the  Drukpa Kagyu and Drigung Kagyu lineages. (The Karma Kagyu, Drukpa Kagyu and  Drigung Kagyu are the three largest Kagyu lineages from Gampopa still thriving  today.)</p>
                    <p>                
                        For the next nine years, Dusum Khyenpa  immersed himself in study&mdash;first of the major Buddhist philosophical texts, and  later of the tantras. At this point in history, Tibet was undergoing a tremendous  upsurge in cultural confidence and spiritual maturity. During the 12th century,  central Tibet  in particular hosted a number of influential <em>lots&#257;was </em>who were major teachers and authors in their own right.  While in T&ouml;lung, Dusum Khyenpa read the most challenging Indian treatises with  the finest teachers of the day. With no less illustrious a scholar than  Gyamarpa (11th century) and his brilliant prodigy Chapa Ch&ouml;kyi Senge  (1109-1169), Dusum Khyenpa studied the principal texts of Asa&#7749;ga, as well as  N&#257;g&#257;rjuna&rsquo;s <em>M&#363;lamadhyamakak&#257;rik&#257;s</em>,  Candrak&#299;rti&rsquo;s <em>Madhyamak&#257;vat&#257;ra</em> and  &#256;ryadeva&rsquo;s <em>Catu&#7717;&#347;ataka</em>, gaining a  firm grounding in the views of the two major streams of Mah&#257;y&#257;na philosophy:  Cittam&#257;tra and Madhyamaka. </p>
                    <p>
                        His training in these texts complete,  Dusum Khyenpa proceeded to the great Kadampa center of Phenyul. As a  particularly promising student, he was taught the six treatises of N&#257;g&#257;rjuna by  Patsab Lots&#257;wa, the 12th century&rsquo;s greatest proponent of Pr&#257;sa&#7749;gika Madhyamaka  philosophy. For a further six years, Dusum Khyenpa studied Kadampa texts under  the Kadam master, Geshe Sharwapa. He further trained in tantra, receiving the  set of six yogic practices associated with the K&#257;lacakra tantra, as well as the  K&#257;kamukha Mah&#257;k&#257;la tantra.</p>
                    <p>
                        During this period, Dusum Khyenpa took  his bhik&#7779;u ordination&mdash;the highest level of monastic ordination. A student of  Geshe Sharwapa, Mel Dulwa Dzinpa (Holder of the Vinaya) acted as preceptor, and  Yeshe Lodr&ouml; as ritual master. Dusum Khyenpa trained thoroughly in the  foundational training for monastics, the <em>vinaya</em>,  excelling to the point where he was asked to teach <em>vinaya</em> to others. </p>

                    <h3>Meeting Gampopa</h3>
                    <p>
                        At the age of 30, Dusum Khyenpa decided  to search out the master who would show him the greatest kindness, leading him  to the highest realization on the path&mdash;Lord Gampopa, also known as Dagpo  Rinpoche. As Dusum Khyenpa was heading to Gampopa&rsquo;s seat at Daglha Gampo, he  first encountered Gampopa&rsquo;s nephew, Gomtsul (1116-1169), and took teachings  from him.</p>
                    <p>    
                        Upon arrival in Daglha Gampo, Dusum  Khyenpa was made to wait two months before Gampopa would receive him. With his  six years of study of the Kadampa teachings and his deep knowledge of the Indian  philosophical treatises, Dusum Khyenpa came to Gampopa with a strong  intellectual understanding of the Dharma. Nevertheless, when Gampopa finally  agreed to receive him, he initially granted Dusum Khyenpa only <em>lam rim </em>or &ldquo;gradual path&rdquo; teachings,  which had already formed part of the basic curriculum that Dusum Khyenpa had  studied for years under Kadampa masters. Gampopa offered the eager Dusum  Khyenpa no secret transmissions or special instructions, but only advised him  to practice the <em>lam rim</em>, saying, &ldquo;I  meditated on this. You should do so too.&rdquo; </p>
                    <p>
                        Though Dusum Khyenpa may have expected  more advanced or esoteric instruction, he diligently followed Gampopa&rsquo;s advice,  and entered solitary retreat for nine months. He engaged with full intensity in  the meditative practices Gampopa had indicated for him, wearing only a single  cotton cloth. He meditated with such exertion that the perspiration never dried  from his hands for nine months. </p>
                    <p>    
                        Over the years, Gampopa guided Dusum  Khyenpa with great skill, offering him instruction for some time and then  sending this determined meditator off to practice in solitude. Gampopa directed  Dusum Khyenpa to meditate in various sites across southern Tibet, ranging from Dagpo, &Ouml;lkha, into Tsang and  down to a border region spanning an area now divided among Tibet, Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh. The  latter territory was ruled by the M&ouml;n king, who granted Dusum Khyenpa right of  passage so that he could wander and meditate at will. Though tigers frequented  the territory, he remained steadfast in his resolve to follow Gampopa&rsquo;s advice  and persisted in his practice. </p>


                    <h3>Gaining Certainty</h3>
                    <p>
                        After training and meditating for several  years in this way, Dusum Khyenpa went to see Gampopa to relate his experience  and seek further instruction. After listening to Dusum Khyenpa&rsquo;s descriptions  of his meditative experiences, Gampopa responded: &ldquo;I had great hopes in you  before, but this is disappointing. You have to keep meditating.&rdquo; Following  Gampopa&rsquo;s advice, Dusum Khyenpa meditated for another six months, but saw no  change in his meditation. Nevertheless, he gained firm conviction in his own  experience, despite Gampopa&rsquo;s assertion of doubt. Dusum Khyenpa stated,  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way this is wrong. Even if it is wrong, this is how I&rsquo;m going to  meditate.&rdquo; In this way, Gampopa guided Dusum Khyenpa to the point of unshakable  certainty in his meditation. This time, when Dusum Khyenpa returned to report  again on his meditation, the great Gampopa placed his hand upon Dusum Khyenpa&rsquo;s  head and told him, &ldquo;Son, you have already severed the bonds to samsara.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>    
                        Dusum Khyenpa became renowned for his  exceptional fortitude in meditation, and was considered supreme among the vast  gathering of meditators practicing under Gampopa&rsquo;s guidance. Although Dusum  Khyenpa&rsquo;s meditative prowess earned him a superior position among the Daglha  Gampo practice community, accounts of his life indicate that he forged close  and lasting ties of friendship with many of his fellow students. In general,  his friends recognized that Dusum Khyenpa was utterly true to his word, and it  is clear that he inspired similar loyalty in others. </p>
                    <p>    
                        While training primarily under Gampopa,  Dusum Khyenpa also had the opportunity to meet Milarepa&rsquo;s other disciple,  Rechungpa (1085-1161), and to receive from him the full transmission of the six  yogas of N&#257;ropa as well as other instructions. </p>
                    <p>    
                        Gampopa himself gave Dusum Khyenpa  personal instructions on Mah&#257;mudr&#257;, as well as instructions on Vajrayogin&#299;  practice. After he had done so, Gampopa advised Dusum Khyenpa to practice Mah&#257;mudr&#257;  far to the east, in an area of Kham called Kampo Gangra. This would be of great  benefit to beings, Gampopa told him.</p>
                    <p>    
                        Although Gampopa was guiding vast numbers  of students at this point, Dusum Khyenpa&rsquo;s tremendous devotion to Gampopa lent  a distinct flavor to their lama-disciple relationship. During  one of the periods Dusum Khyenpa was staying at Daglha Gampo, Gampopa  distributed cloth to his three close disciples from Kham&mdash;Seltong Shogom (b.  12th century), Phagmodrupa and Dusum Khyenpa, known among Gampopa&rsquo;s disciples  as the Three Men from Kham. Gampopa instructed each of them to make a hat from  the material. Dusum Khyenpa valued so highly the cloth he received from his  lama that he painstakingly fashioned it into the most beautiful shape he could.  Some time later, Gampopa called the three of them and asked them to bring the  hats they had made. Seltong Shogom had neglected to attend to the task, but  when the summons came, he hastily attempted to craft the material into a  hat-like shape. Dusum Khyenpa, meanwhile, arrived with the resplendent hat he  had taken such care to construct. </p>
                    <p>    
                        Dusum Khyenpa&rsquo;s exertions with the fabric  reveal a great deal about his character. His care in transforming what Gampopa  had given him into a glorious crown was interpreted as an auspicious sign for  the future of the lineage he had received from Gampopa and would himself pass  on&mdash;the lineage known today as the Karma Kagyu. Indeed, Dusum Khyenpa&rsquo;s efforts  to preserve and value what Gampopa had given him have yielded beautiful and  long-lasting results. A replica of this hat is still worn by the Karmapa today.  Known as the Multi-Colored Hat, it serves as a substitute for the lama, who in  many Tibetan Buddhist practices is visualized atop the crown of the disciple&rsquo;s  head. </p>

                    <h3>Losing his Lama</h3>
                    <p>
                        In 1953, 14 years after Dusum Khyenpa met  Gampopa, the lama who had cared for him so kindly passed away. Dusum Khyenpa  learned of the loss when he met Gampopa&rsquo;s nephew Gomtsul and a second disciple  named Phagpa in &Ouml;lkha. Clutching a garment that had belonged to Gampopa, Dusum  Khyenpa made supplications and wept. As he did so, a vision of  Gampopa appeared in the sky, clearly visible to all three of them <em>(see photo left)</em>. The astonishing  apparition did much to assuage Dusum Khyenpa&rsquo;s pain, and he commented, &ldquo;The  lama came to dispel my grief.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>                    
                        Every year thereafter, Dusum Khyenpa  marked the anniversary of Gampopa&rsquo;s death, and later established the practice  of doing so in the monasteries he himself founded. Dusum Khyenpa retained a  deep gratitude and a sense of commitment not only to Gampopa himself but also  to his seat at Daglha Gampo. Throughout his life, when Dusum Khyenpa received  large offerings, he frequently sent them to Daglha Gampo to support the  community and facilities that Gampopa had founded. </p>
                    <p>    
                        Some time after the passing of the great  master had been ritually marked in the customary manner, Dusum Khyenpa  recollected the advice his lama had given him to travel east to Kham and  practice Mah&#257;mudr&#257; in the area of Kampo Gangra. His decision to do so met with  objections. In the absence of their teacher, and with a massive assembly of  practitioners at Daglha Gampo needing guidance, Dusum Khyenpa had ample  opportunities to benefit beings and the Dharma without leaving Daglha Gampo. As  he prepared to depart for Kham, his Dharma friends attempted to dissuade him.  His long-time friend Phagmodrupa urged Dusum Khyenpa to remain at Daglha Gampo,  saying, &ldquo;If you go to Kham, you will have to give many initiations. This will  shorten your life.&rdquo; In general, giving tantric empowerments to those who have  not guarded their <em>samaya (</em>or tantric  commitments) purely can have a devastating impact on the health and lifespan of  the lama conferring such empowerments. By leaving the community of meditators  at Daglha Gampo, Phagmodrupa was concerned that Dusum Khyenpa was running a  personal risk by interacting with less committed practitioners. </p>
                    <p>     
                        Dusum Khyenpa replied to Phagmodrupa, &ldquo;It  is very kind of you to be concerned for me, but I am going to live to the age  of 84, whether or not I give empowerments. There will be no premature death for  me.&rdquo; </p>
                    <p>     
                        With the utmost confidence born of his  own realization and his trust in his lama, Dusum Khyenpa departed for Kham in  accordance with Gampopa&rsquo;s advice&mdash;and indeed he did live to the age of 84 as he  predicted he would. </p>

                    <h3>Return to Kham</h3>

                    <p>
                        Three decades after he had left, at the  age of 50, Dusum Khyenpa completed the journey back to his native region of  Kham. As Gampopa had instructed, he meditated on Mah&#257;mudr&#257; in the Kampo Gangra  area. During this period, Dusum Khyenpa engaged in dream yoga practice as well  as Mah&#257;mudr&#257;, and attained a level of realization wherein he was able to  dissolve the boundary between sleep and wakefulness and between meditation and  his ordinary activities. His Mah&#257;mudr&#257; realization reached the fourth  stage&mdash;that of non-meditation. </p>
                    <p>    
                        While in Kham, Dusum Khyenpa swiftly  began to attract disciples, and before long the number of monks in his  community exceeded 1,000. In 1164, Dusum Khyenpa founded Kampo Nenang  monastery, on a spot tucked among gentle peaks. There he established a retreat  center and monastery, and devoted the next two decades of his life to  cultivating realization in the many students who came seeking his guidance. As  his first major seat, Kampo Nenang was powerfully imbued with Dusum Khyenpa&rsquo;s  presence. To this day, the letter <em>A</em> appears on a boulder at Kampo Nenang whenever a Karmapa has been reborn in the  world<a name="_GoBack"></a><em>.</em> </p>
                    <p>   
                        At Kampo Nenang, Dusum Khyenpa received  Drog&ouml;n Rechen (also known as Sangye Rechen Peldrag, 1148-1218), his heart  disciple. Along with transmitting Dusum  Khyenpa&rsquo;s lineage, Drog&ouml;n Rechen became instrumental in recognizing that the  Second Karmapa, Karma Pakshi, was, in fact, the reincarnation of Dusum Khyenpa.  It was to Drog&ouml;n Rechen that Dusum Khyenpa entrusted the letter granting  details of his next incarnation. In that letter, Dusum Khyenpa declared that he  would return, for the sake of one single being. </p>
                    <p>   
                        Along with fulfilling his life&rsquo;s purpose  of caring for his students, Dusum Khyenpa was active in dispelling disputes,  mediating between feuding factions across Kham. His skillful interventions, and  in some cases his mere presence, repeatedly resulted in the resolution of  deeply entrenched animosities and personal conflicts. This pattern of  peacemaking recurs again and again in the lives of Dusum Khyenpa&rsquo;s successors  in the Karmapa reincarnation line, and forms a key component of their activity  in the world. </p>
                    <p>   
                        At the age of 74, Dusum Khyenpa founded  his second major seat, Karma G&ouml;n monastery. </p>
                    <p>    
                        Throughout this time, even as he was  developing his own monastic seats, Dusum Khyenpa continued sending offerings  back to Daglha Gampo. On one occasion, he dispatched a caravan with 70  yak-loads of tea. </p>

                    <h3>Deeds in Central Tibet</h3>

                    <p>
                        Years before, when Dusum Khyenpa was  still residing in central Tibet, Gampopa&rsquo;s nephew, Gomtsul, had counseled him  that, come what may, he should return to central Tibet after his time in Kham.  Ever valuing each instruction he had received from his teachers, Dusum Khyenpa  was determined to honor this advice, despite his advanced years. Marpa too had  displayed similarly exceptional determination when he undertook his third trip  to India  in his old age. But unlike Marpa, Dusum Khyenpa harbored no hopes of reuniting  with his lama at the other end of the journey, for by this time both Gampopa  and Gomtsul had passed away. His huge circle of disciples at Kampo Nenang,  Karma G&ouml;n and elsewhere across the region offered him more than ample  opportunity to be of benefit in Kham. Yet, in his late 70s, Dusum Khyenpa  undertook the arduous journey, meeting his commitments to his teachers, and  guided by his own sense of what more he might do for others. </p>
                    <p>     
                        Once he had reached central Tibet, Dusum  Khyenpa first visited Daglha Gampo, where he taught extensively, oversaw  reconstruction of buildings that had fallen into disrepair and offered a  100-volume scriptural collection written by hand in gold to the monastery. </p>
                    <p>     
                        Dusum Khyenpa&rsquo;s powers to pacify dispute  were urgently needed in central Tibet as well, for a fellow disciple of Gampopa  named Lama Zhang (Tselpa Tsundru Dragpa, 1123/1121-1193) was exhibiting  increasingly wrathful behavior that was incurring considerable social  disapproval. Although many others had attempted to convince Lama Zhang to  renounce his activities, none had met with success. However, during a meeting  with Dusum Khyenpa, the highly unconventional Lama Zhang is said to have danced  wildly about the room, tugged on one of Dusum Khyenpa&rsquo;s fingers, and then  immediately renounced his controversial behavior once and for all. Through his  activities in negotiating with Lama Zhang, Dusum Khyenpa made an important  contribution to peace in central Tibet.</p>
                    <p>     
                        Another major deed of Dusum Khyenpa  during this period was the founding of Tsurphu Monastery, west of Lhasa in T&ouml;lung, the area  where Dusum Khyenpa had himself first come to study as a young man. Tsurphu  would go on to become a thriving center for study and practice, and an  important site for the continuity of the Karmapa reincarnation line. For more  than 900 years, in every single successive lifetime, the Karmapa has resided  for some period at Tsurphu Monastery. </p>

                    <h3>His Final Teaching</h3>
                    <p>
                        With the far-ranging deeds of his life  thus complete, in 1193, Dusum Khyenpa entrusted his books and relics to his  main student, Drog&ouml;n Rechen, and gave away the remainder of his possessions to  various Dharma communities in Gampopa&rsquo;s lineage. On the third day of the  Tibetan New Year, Dusum Khyenpa gave a final Dharma teaching to the assembly at  Tsurphu, lifted his gaze to the sky and entered meditation. He sat thus  meditating for the remainder of the morning. At noon, the First Karmapa  relinquished the body he had used so well to benefit beings in that lifetime,  and moved on to take the next. </p>
                    <p>      
                        After the great master had passed on,  Dusum Khyenpa&rsquo;s friend and Dharma brother from Daglha Gampo, Lholayapa, heard  of Dusum Khyenpa&rsquo;s passing. He commented, &ldquo;One should care for one&rsquo;s friend&rsquo;s  main seats,&rdquo; and voluntarily gave up his own activities to oversee the  transition at Tsurphu. Coming to care for Tsurphu Monastery for a few years,  Dusum Khyenpa&rsquo;s friend helped to bridge the interim period before the Second  Karmapa was discovered and could resume that responsibility. This generous act  of Lholayapa&rsquo;s stands as one last testimony to the devotion and loyalty that  Dusum Khyenpa inspired not only in his students but also in his friends. </p>
                    <p>     
                        From his early life&mdash;as he evolved from a  teenager filled with jealous rage to one filled with deep remorse&mdash;to his  determination to return to this world in a new body to carry on his work for  beings, Dusum Khyenpa displayed the capacity to transform as needed that is the  true mark of a holy being. His overriding commitment to those under his care  served as a driving force in his life and in his death. With the boundless  creativity that remains a hallmark of the Karmapa reincarnation line to this  day, Dusum Khyenpa found a previously unimagined way to guide his disciples all  the way to enlightenment. In the end, not even death could prevent the Karmapa  from continuing his care of his disciples and his transmission of the  Buddhadharma.</p>

                    <h3>2nd &ndash; 15th  Karmapa</h3>
                    <p>
                        The stream of reincarnations that Dusum  Khyenpa initiated has flowed onward for the past nine centuries. In each  successive life, through the shifting historical terrain, Dusum Khyenpa&rsquo;s  reincarnations have found new pathways forward for the Dharma and for the  disciples they are leading to enlightenment. </p>
                    <p>     
                        Through periods of tumult, and through  periods of peace, the Karmapa incarnations have kept returning, repeatedly  responding to changing times to find optimum ways to continue their work for  the sake of beings and the Dharma. In times of great flourishing of the Karma  Kagyu teachings, Dusum Khyenpa&rsquo;s reincarnations presided over vast gatherings  in their main seats and moved in great caravans across the Tibetan plateau to  reach those who could not come to them. In adverse times, they guarded the  advances that had been made and sought out other ways to be of benefit.&nbsp; When conditions were conducive to their  activities, they cared for their disciples and transmitted the teachings of the  lineage. When conditions were not conducive for their activities, they cared  for their disciples, transmitted the teachings of their lineage and improvised  new forms of activity. </p>
                    <p>     
                        The very name of this reincarnation line,  Karmapa, literally means &ldquo;Being of Activity,&rdquo; and indicates that the Karmapa  carries out the enlightened activities of the buddhas. Since buddhas themselves  have limitless capacities, the activity of buddhas is by definition bound only  by the limits of possibility. Historically, the Karmapa reincarnations on  occasion have tested the limits of what ordinarily seems possible, finding new  spheres of activity to emphasize in different lives.&nbsp; Through these activities, they have  contributed greatly to Tibetan culture through their literary and artistic  contributions, and have shaped Tibetan history through their frequent activity  as peacemakers. </p>
                    <p>     
                        All the activities of the Karmapa, like  all the activities of the buddhas, are animated by the aim of freeing beings  from suffering and leading them to the highest form of happiness. Because they  spring from a being whose mind is limitless, those activities manifest in as  many forms as there are suffering beings. The Fifth Karmapa, Deshin Shegpa,  declared that he had been born to tame the emperor of China, and his accomplishment of that aim  resulted in centuries of peace in Tibet. The Tenth Karmapa, Ch&ouml;ying  Dorje, lived in a time when outer conditions were extremely adverse, but  directed great energy towards the creation of deeply inspiring artwork and  poetry. Born in Tibet under  communist Chinese rule, at the age of fourteen, the Seventeenth Karmapa braved  the dangers of a Himalayan crossing to India, in hopes of finding the  needed conditions to function fully as Karmapa there.</p>
                    <p>     
                        With the same tenacity and fierce  commitment Dusum Khyenpa displayed in his lifetime, each successive Karmapa has  cultivated goodness in whatever soil they have encountered. Displaying the same  creative capacities seen in Dusum Khyenpa&rsquo;s founding of the institution of reincarnate  lamas, all the Karmapas have found a way to cultivate the most abundant  flourishing possible&mdash;always leaving the soil far richer than they had found it. </p>   

                    <h1><u>2. The Second Karmapa, Karma Pakshi (1206-1283)</u></h1>
                    <p ><img src="img/previous-karmapas-6.jpg" alt="">
                        Dusum  Khyenpa returned as Karma Pakshi, as he had predicted in the letter he left  with his heart disciple, Drog&ouml;n Rechen (1148-1218). It was later revealed to  Drog&ouml;n Rechen&rsquo;s disciple Pomdrakpa (1170-1249), in startlingly clear visions,  that Karma Pakshi was in fact the reincarnation of Dusum Khyenpa. </p>
                    <p>       
                        As the first  figure in history to be identified as the next reincarnation of a living  master, it was incumbent on Karma Pakshi to display his exceptional qualities,  to dispel the doubts that would surely arise. </p>
                    <p>       
                        Indeed, Karma Pakshi is renowned  as one of the greatest masters in Tibetan history in terms of his miraculous  powers, and is often ranked in a class with Padmasambhava for such skills. </p>

                    <p ><img src="img/previous-karmapas-8.jpg" alt="" >
                        The  Karmapa generally engages in particular activities as central to each life&rsquo;s  work. Karma Pakshi&rsquo;s major deed was the taming of M&ouml;ngke Khan (1209-1259), who  rapidly progressed spiritually under Karma Pakshi&rsquo;s guidance.</p>
                    <p >    
                        Karma Pakshi had  initially traveled to the court of his brother, Kublai (reigned 1260-1294), but  left that court rather than become embroiled in its intensive politicized  intrigues.</p>
                    <p >   
                        When Kublai Khan succeeded M&ouml;ngke Khan as emperor, he bitterly  resented that earlier slight, and sought to have Karma Pakshi incarcerated and  even killed, unsuccessfully.</p>
                    <p >   
                        Karma Pakshi&rsquo;s equanimity and compassion throughout  the terrible persecution later sparked a complete change of heart by the  emperor, who apologized and requested Karma Pakshi to teach him Dharma.  &ldquo;Pakshi&rdquo; is a Mongolian title meaning &ldquo;Great Teacher.&rdquo; </p>

                    <h1><u>3. The Third Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje (1284-1339)</u></h1>
                    <p><img src="img/previous-karmapas-10.jpg" alt="" >
                        The  Dharma is said to have two forms, the verbal form found in texts, and the  realizations that arise in the minds of beings. The Third Karmapa made  spectacular contributions in both forms, through the important scriptural works  he composed and sponsored, and through the spiritual attainments of his  students. In general, the greatness of their students is a significant measure  of a teacher&rsquo;s greatness&mdash;and the disciples of Rangjung Dorje who attained <em>siddhis </em>numbered 80. </p>
                    <p >    
                        In terms of Dharma in its textual form,  Rangjung Dorje was active in the movement of his day to compile and edit the  Buddhist canonical collections. In the 1330s, in between two trips to teach at  the Chinese imperial court, Rangjung Dorje commissioned and donated the  materials for an edition of the entire canonical collection of Indian  commentaries, known as the <em>Tengyur</em>.  This edition commissioned by Rangjung Dorje was written by hand in gold and  silver. Known as the &ldquo;gold <em>Tengyur,&rdquo;</em> where it was produced, this is believed to be the very first edition of the  commentarial canon in Tibet  written in gold. A prolific author himself, Rangjung Dorje composed <em>The Hundred Past Lives of the Teacher, </em>a  magnificent literary work describing 100 of Buddha&rsquo;s past lives. Until Rangjung  Dorje&rsquo;s inspired work, the longest collection of Buddha&rsquo;s past lives had  stopped at 34, the remainder having been lost over time. </p>

                    <h1><u>4. The Fourth  Karmapa, Rolpe Dorje (1340-1383)</u></h1>
                    <p ><img src="img/previous-karmapas-12.jpg" alt="" >
                        The  activities of the Fourth Karmapa left lasting marks not only in the spiritual  realm, but also in terms of Tibetan culture and history.&nbsp; It was Rolpe Dorje who created the Great  Encampment of the Karmapas, transforming his growing entourage into a  structured mobile community of meditative practice, study and production.  Rather than await the arrival of disciples in his main seats, Rolpe Dorje was  able to reach out to offer the Dharma where necessary across Tibet. </p>
                    <p >    
                        The Fourth Karmapa lived during a time of  protracted conflict between the Sakya and Drigung Kagyu orders of Tibetan  Buddhism. With courage and skill, he stepped into an active peacemaking role in  this complex dispute. To that end, Rolpe Dorje exchanged initiations with S&ouml;nam  Gyaltsen (1312-1375), one of the supreme Sakya lamas&mdash;making a powerful  statement of respect and appreciation for that sect&rsquo;s teachings&mdash;but he also  directed material resources towards the restoration of the Drigung monastery.  In this wise way, Rolpe Dorje cultivated harmonious relationships with both  factions, and then used his influence to work for peace between them.&nbsp; The Fourth Karmapa additionally played a part  in the inception of what would become Tibet&rsquo;s  largest sect, the Gelug, when he gave lay vows to Je Tsongkhapa (1357-1419) as a young boy and predicted that he would be of great importance to  the future of Buddhism in Tibet. </p>

                    <h1><u>5. The Fifth  Karmapa, Deshin Shegpa (1384-1415)</u></h1>
                    <p ><img src="img/previous-karmapas-14.jpg" alt="" >
                        When  the Fifth Karmapa was in his early 20s, he accepted an invitation from the  ruler of Ming-dynasty China,  Yongle Emperor, to travel to China,  teach at the imperial court and perform funeral services for the emperor&rsquo;s  deceased parents. Though his status as the emperor&rsquo;s lama granted Deshin Shegpa  enormous influence and power, he repeatedly declined to exercise that power to  promote his own sect. The Yuan dynasty had sent military forces to Tibet with  the consent or encouragement of Tibetan religious figures, as would the Qing  dynasty emperors centuries later. </p>
                    <p >
                        But when the Fifth Karmapa was presented with  a proposal by Yongle Emperor to send military forces to curtail other sects&rsquo;  activities in Tibet and support the Karma Kagyu, Deshin Shegpa reportedly  replied that a variety of teaching traditions were needed in Tibet, to suit the  variety of disciples&rsquo; predispositions and needs, and that each sect made a  distinct contribution. In this way, he was able to avert a planned invasion of Tibet  by the Ming emperor. Due to the Fifth Karmapa&rsquo;s truly enlightened perspective  and his deft response to the emperor&rsquo;s ambitions, the Ming dynasty (1368-1644)  was dissuaded from pursuing imperial designs on Tibet. The fact that, for the three  centuries of Ming rule, Tibet  was able to pursue its religious and secular affairs free of external  interference was a lasting contribution of the Fifth Karmapa, and may be  counted among his major enlightened activities.</p>

                    <h1><u>6.The Sixth Karmapa, Tongwa D&ouml;nden (1416-1452)</u></h1>
                    <p ><img src="img/previous-karmapas-16.jpg" alt="">
                        The  Sixth Karmapa, Tongwa D&ouml;nden, was the first Karmapa in two centuries to decline  the Chinese emperor&rsquo;s invitation to teach at his court. After the actions of  the Fifth Karmapa had laid the groundwork for centuries of peaceful relations  between China and Tibet,  the Sixth could remain on Tibetan territory, focusing his energy on matters  closer at hand. </p>
                    <p >    
                        Throughout his life, the Sixth Karmapa  engaged in meditative retreats, ranged across Tibet with the Great Encampment,  from Kham to Kongpo to &Uuml;, teaching large assemblies and restoring monasteries  he found in disrepair.</p>
                    <p >    
                        As a major deed of that incarnation, the  Sixth Karmapa brought about a profound invigoration of ritual and tantric  practice in the Karma Kagyu. Tongwa D&ouml;nden began composing tantric rituals at  an exceptionally early age, and produced a vast number of meditation and ritual  manuals. By the end of his life, Tongwa D&ouml;nden had created an entire liturgical  corpus, which to this day forms the basis for ritual activity within the Karma  Kagyu lineage. His lasting contribution is enacted, and his enlightened  activity is present, each time a Karma Kagyu practitioner recites one of the  ritual compositions that arose in his mind. </p>

                    <h1><u>7. The Seventh  Karmapa, Ch&ouml;drak Gyatso (1454-1506)</u></h1>
                    <p ><img src="img/previous-karmapas-18.jpg" alt="" >
                        During  the lifetime of the Seventh Karmapa, the Great Encampment of the Karmapas  expanded greatly, earning him the epithet &ldquo;Ch&ouml;drak Gyatso of the Great  Encampment.&rdquo; Ch&ouml;drak Gyatso created the practice of holding massive prayer  festivals on the major Buddhist holidays, establishing the precedent for  today&rsquo;s Kagyu Monlam Chenno.</p>
                    <p >    
                        The widely learned Ch&ouml;drak Gyatso  introduced a formal study institute (<em>shedra</em>)  into the Great Encampment itself, and similarly created a <em>shedra </em>at Tsurphu Monastery. An accomplished scholar, the Seventh  Karmapa authored a number of influential commentaries on Indian philosophical  treatises. His text on epistemology, the multi-volume <em>Ocean of Reasoning</em>, remains one of his most important works,  alongside his commentary on the <em>Abhisamayala&#7749;k&#257;ra</em>,  the <em>Lamp of the Three Worlds</em>. </p>
                    <p >    
                        While these formed his major deeds,  Ch&ouml;drak Gyatso&rsquo;s varied activities to benefit beings also included bridge  construction, the resolution of factional disputes and protection of animals.  As had been the case in the Great Encampment since its inception, no meat  whatsoever was consumed&mdash;or even allowed within the camp. </p>

                    <h1><u>8. The</u><u> Eighth</u><u> Karmapa</u><u>, Miky</u><u>&ouml; Dorje</u><u> (1507-1554)</u></h1>
                    <p ><img src="img/previous-karmapas-20.jpg" alt="" >
                        Miky&ouml;  Dorje is among the greatest scholars Tibet has ever produced. He was an  active participant in the rigorous intellectual debates of his day, making  major contributions in virtually all areas of textual study. He was an  accomplished Sanskritist, and wrote Sanskrit grammars alongside works ranging  from poetry to art to tantra. The Eighth Karmapa&rsquo;s voluminous writings include  substantial commentaries on all the principal Sanskrit texts, clarifying points  of confusion and deeply engaging with their inner meaning.</p>
                    <p >     
                        The act of composing philosophical texts  within the Karma Kagyu&mdash;a lineage so fully devoted to attaining realization  through practice&mdash;is wholly unlike the act of producing philosophical texts in a  modern academic or scholastic setting. Rather, the philosophical works of Miky&ouml;  Dorje point out the way to view reality in order to be liberated from the  cycles of samsaric suffering. As such, his compositions are a supreme act of  kindness. </p>
                    <p >     
                        It is said that Miky&ouml; Dorje&rsquo;s deeds in  recording his insight and understanding in his commentaries had the effect of  doubling or tripling the lifespan of the Karma Kagyu lineage. </p>

                    <h1><u>9. The</u><u> Ninth</u><u> Karmapa</u><u>, Wangchuk</u><u> Dorje</u><u> (1556-1603)</u></h1>
                    <p ><img src="img/previous-karmapas-22.jpg" alt="" >
                        In his  ninth reincarnation, as Wangchuk Dorje, the Karmapa again took as a major  activity the composition of texts that would guide his and future generations  in their practice. Unlike Miky&ouml; Dorje with his wide-ranging corpus of texts,  Wangchuk Dorje focused primarily on Mah&#257;mudr&#257;.
                    </p>
                    <p >    
                        Rooted  in the direct encounter with ultimate reality, Mah&#257;mudr&#257; is often described as  beyond words and beyond concepts. Training in Mah&#257;mudr&#257; must generally be  conducted under the personal guidance of a qualified teacher who can point  disciples to the direct experience of the nature of their own mind. As such,  Wangchuk Dorje was accepting an enormously challenging explanatory task, since  Mah&#257;mudr&#257;, by its very nature, eludes conceptual formulation.</p>
                    <p >     
                        Nevertheless, Wangchuk Dorje&rsquo;s own  realizations of Mah&#257;mudr&#257; and his exceptional skill in articulating those  realizations combined to bear fruit in the form of three texts: <em>Ocean</em><em> of Definitive    Meaning</em><em>,  Pointing Out the Dharmak&#257;ya </em>and <em>Dispelling  the Darkness of Ignorance</em>. These three compositions form the backbone of  Mah&#257;mudr&#257; explanation in the Karma Kagyu today. As a later Karmapa pointed out,  without these texts by Wangchuk Dorje, the Karma Kagyu today would have few  written resources to turn to in order to explain Mah&#257;mudr&#257; practice. </p>

                    <h1><u>10. The Tenth  Karmapa, Ch&ouml;ying Dorje (1604-1674)</u></h1>
                    <p ><img src="img/previous-karmapas-26.jpg" alt="" >
                        The  Tenth Karmapa lived through a turbulent time that brought dramatic changes to  the position of the Karma Kagyu in Tibet. Yet his response to those  changes provides an inspiring example of perseverance, equanimity and pure  goodness in the face of adversity.</p> 
                    <p >
                        The 17th century&rsquo;s sectarianism  resulted in the return of Mongol forces to Tibetan soil. In one terrible  attack, the entire Great Encampment was demolished, its residents all killed.  Only Ch&ouml;ying Dorje and an attendant managed to escape, and eventually made  their way to the independent kingdom   of Lijiang far to the  east. Though Ch&ouml;ying Dorje found himself bereft of the usual conditions for  spreading the teachings of his lineage, he inspired the Lijiang rulers to  become devoted supporters who offered him a welcoming haven and new base for  his activities. </p>
                    <p >
                        In order to safeguard the future of the lineage, the Tenth  Karmapa reportedly made secret excursions into Kham and Amdo, traveling  incognito, to bring the Sixth Tai Situpa and other important young Karma Kagyu  incarnations back to Lijiang for training. In the meantime, with the  characteristic creativity and resolve of the Karmapa, Ch&ouml;ying Dorje found other  activities that allowed him to bring beauty to the world. The Tenth Karmapa  created at least one sacred image Each and every day of his adult life. </p>

                    <h1><u>11. The Eleventh  Karmapa, Yeshe Dorje (1676-1702)</u></h1>

                    <p ><img src="img/previous-karmapas-28.jpg" alt="" >
                        Since  the time of Dusum Khyenpa, the Karmapas frequently took rebirth in Kham,  established ties with Karma Kagyu monasteries in eastern Tibet, and then made the long trek to take up  residence at Tsurphu Monastery in central Tibet. This allowed the Karma Kagyu  lineage to retain strong ties across widely dispersed geographical territories.  Yeshe Dorje followed this pattern, and soon began engaging in the traditional  activities of the Karmapas. After his formal enthronement at Tsurphu, he  performed the Black Crown Ceremony, took ordination, received the transmissions  of the lineage and studied the scriptural texts. He took teachings from Nyingma  as well as Kagyu masters, including Yonge Mingyur Rinpoche. </p>
                    <p >    
                        Like Ch&ouml;ying Dorje before him, Yeshe  Dorje enjoyed far less conducive conditions than previous Karmapas for acting  to benefit the world widely. However, he acted fully on whatever terms he  found, repairing the extensive damage that had been done to Tsurphu by the  Mongolian army, caring for his disciples and training new lineage lamas. Yeshe  Dorje was the shortest-lived of all the Karmapa reincarnations, passing away at  the age of 27. During his brief lifetime, he worked with quiet determination to  protect what had been left to him by the vicissitudes of history. </p>

                    <h1><u>12. The Twelfth  Karmapa, Jangchub Dorje (1703-1732)</u></h1>

                    <p ><img src="img/previous-karmapas-30.jpg" alt="" >
                        Also  facing adverse conditions for the lineage, Jangchub Dorje invested great care  in his ties to the major Karma Kagyu lineage lamas. He nurtured as his heart  disciple the Eighth Tai Situpa Ch&ouml;kyi Jungne (1700-1774), also known as Situ  Panchen in recognition of his enormous erudition.&nbsp; The Eighth Situpa became a great patron of  the arts, as well as a productive scholar, who edited and oversaw the carving  of the woodblock editions of the <em>Kangyur </em>and <em>Tengyur </em>canonical collections at  Derge Monastery in Kham. </p>
                    <p >    
                        Taking his heart disciple Situ Panchen as  well as the Eighth Shamar Rinpoche and the Seventh Goshir Gyaltsap Rinpoche  with him, the Twelfth Karmapa undertook a pilgrimage to Nepal and India.&nbsp; Arriving in the Kathmandu  valley, they were received with great honors by the Nepali king.&nbsp; At the time of the Karmapa&rsquo;s visit, an  epidemic was sweeping the valley, which he was requested to dispel. He  performed a blessing ceremony connected to Avalokite&#347;vara, and the epidemic did  end, earning the king&rsquo;s devotion and gratitude. Meanwhile, Situ Panchen, a  learned Sanskrit scholar, was able to debate with local pandits in Sanskrit.  After teaching in Nepal for  some time, Jangchub Dorje and his party continued their pilgrimage, visiting  sacred Buddhist sites of India. </p>

                    <h1><u>13. The  Thirteenth Karmapa, D&uuml;dul Dorje (1733-1797)</u></h1>

                    <p ><img src="img/previous-karmapas-32.jpg" alt="" >
                        During  the previous three reincarnations, relations between the Lhasa government and the Karma Kagyu order  had remained difficult. Through his extraordinary skill, D&uuml;dul Dorje was able  to begin the process of healing the relationship. He did so not through  political negotiation, but through the pure exercise of his spiritual powers.  One year when the Kyichu River breached its banks, threatening to flood Lhasa, it was recalled that Padmasambhava had made a  relevant prophecy many centuries earlier, suggesting that if one day Lhasa was in danger of  inundation, the Karmapa&rsquo;s help should be sought.&nbsp; When the city officials duly requested D&uuml;dul  Dorje&rsquo;s assistance, he composed a special letter to be placed on the  floodwaters, and from Tsurphu invoked the compassion of Avalokite&#347;vara. The  waters receded, and, with them, some of the animosity that had complicated the  Karma Kagyu relationship with the Lhasa-based government.</p>
                    <p >
                        He later visited  Lhasa, and it is said that when he was offering a white scarf to the central  Jowo image, its arms moved and have remained in the new position ever since.  D&uuml;dul Dorje was also received by the Eighth Dalai Lama, in gratitude for his  timely intervention during the threat of flooding. The Thirteenth Karmapa was  broadly known for his overwhelming compassion for beings. The force of his  compassion was so palpable that animals used to flock to him of their own accord&mdash;birds,  mice, cats, rabbits and bees. Due to that, it is said that he was able to  impart something of the Dharma to them in this way. </p>

                    <h1><u>14. The  Fourteenth Karmapa, Tekchok Dorje (1798-1868)</u></h1>
                    <p ><img src="img/previous-karmapas-34.jpg" alt="" >
                        From  early in life, the Fourteenth Karmapa displayed an aptitude for enlightened  activity in a wide range of domains. He was renowned for his personal  asceticism and strict observance of monastic discipline, inspiring those around  him to reach his high level of practice as well. A skilled artist, he also  devoted a good deal of his time to the writing of poetry. A lasting  contribution of Tekchok Dorje&rsquo;s creativity can be seen in the courtyards of  Tsurphu and Rumtek monasteries to this day. </p>
                    <p >
                        It was he who established the  distinctive Padmasambhava ritual dancing (or <em>cham</em>) that became a Tsurphu tradition, as well as Vajrak&#299;laya <em>cham</em> dancing. The two ritual dance  practices were maintained as part of Tsurphu&rsquo;s tradition until 1959, when the  Sixteenth Karmapa went into exile. Nowadays, both practices are preserved at  Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim,  while Tsurphu maintains only the Padmasambhava ritual dancing. Anticipating his  involvement in his next life as the Fifteenth Karmapa, Tekchok Dorje&nbsp; played an active role in the <em>Rim&eacute;</em>, or Non-Sectarian Movement, that  began to sweep eastern Tibet  during his lifetime. He exchanged teachings with the <em>Rim&eacute;</em>&nbsp; masters Jamg&ouml;n Kongtrul  Lodr&ouml; Thaye (1813-1899), and Chogyur Lingpa (1829-1870). </p>

                    <h1><u>15. The</u><u> Fifteenth</u><u> Karmapa</u><u>, Khakhyab</u><u> Dorje</u><u> (1871-1922)</u></h1>
                    <p ><img src="img/previous-karmapas-36.jpg" alt="" >
                        From  his very recognition and enthronement as the Fifteenth Karmapa, Khakhyab Dorje continued his previous incarnation&rsquo;s ties to the Rim&eacute; Movement of eastern Tibet.  Khakhyab Dorje was identified by a group of lamas that included two of the main  figures driving the movement: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamyang_Khyentse_Wangpo">Jamyang  Khyentse Wangpo</a> (1820&ndash;1892) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamgon_Kongtrul_Lodro_Thaye">Jamg&ouml;n  Kongtrul Lodr&ouml; Thaye</a>.&nbsp; From an  early age, Khakhyab Dorje directed his energies to his education, seeking out  the most learned teachers and applying himself to his studies with great  results. At the age of 15, he traveled from Tsurphu to Palpung Monastery to  meet Jamg&ouml;n Kongtrul Lodr&ouml; Thaye, from whom he received the entire Kagyu  transmission and Lodr&ouml; Thaye&rsquo;s own vast collection known as the <em>Five Treasuries. </em>From there, the  Fifteenth Karmapa began traveling across eastern Tibet seeking out other  transmissions and teachers&mdash;Sakya, Nyingma, Drukpa Kagyu, Shangpa Kagyu and his  own Karma Kagyu. In this way, Khakhyab Dorje fully embodied the spirit of  inclusiveness and openness that characterized the Rim&eacute; movement. </p>
                    <p >    
                        The Rim&eacute; movement went well beyond mere  tolerance of other sects, to become an active embracing of the wisdom that  other lineages had preserved. Coming as it did after centuries of sectarian  strife that placed many lineages at risk of extinction, one of the chief aims  of the movement was to share transmissions to ensure they continued. Rim&eacute; was  thus infused with the active wish to care for one another, for the well-being  of all. </p>

                    <h1><u>16. His Holiness  the Sixteenth Karmapa, Rangjung Rigpe Dorje (1924-1981)</u></h1>

                    <p >
                        <img src="img/previous-karmapas-38.jpg" alt="" >
                        The  Sixteenth Karmapa shepherded his disciples and his lineage through the most  traumatic upheaval that Tibetan Buddhism has faced since the time of the First  Karmapa. The Sixteenth Karmapa was born in the East and died in the West. In  between, not only did he set the Karma Kagyu lineage on firm and stable ground  in exile, he also spread the Buddha&rsquo;s teachings in the fertile soil he found  farther afield, in Europe and America.  With the adaptability typical of the Karmapa line, as he left his home in Tibet far  behind, His Holiness was able to sow seeds of Dharma that flourished richly in  the very different climate of Western minds. </p>
                    <p >    
                        On the 15th day of the 6th  month of the Tibetan lunar calendar, in 1924, the Karmapa&rsquo;s enduring commitment  to serve sentient beings led him to take birth once again. For this sixteenth  rebirth, the Karmapa chose the aristocratic Athup family, and was born in  Kham&mdash;a region in eastern Tibet  where the Karmapa took birth in many lifetimes, including his current lifetime  as the Seventeenth Karmapa.</p>
                    <p >    
                        Meanwhile, eager to find the  reincarnation of their lama&mdash;the Fifteenth Karmapa&mdash;Situ Rinpoche and Jamg&ouml;n  Kongtrul Rinpoche opened the prediction letter that he had left with an  attendant to guide them to his next birthplace. Inside, they found a  description of the location of the home, mentioning the Athup family by name  and specifying the date of birth as the 15th day of the 6th  month. Situ Rinpoche and Jamg&ouml;n Kongtrul Rinpoche sent a search party to  determine whether a child might have been born to the family on such a date.  The moment they met the remarkable son of the Athup family, the search was  successfully concluded. The Eleventh Tai Situpa formally recognized him as the  Sixteenth Karmapa, and sought the confirmation of that identification by His  Holiness the Dalai Lama. Tai Situ Rinpoche then enthroned the Gyalwang Karmapa  at the age of seven at Palpung Monastery, the seat of the Tai Situpa  reincarnation line. Soon thereafter, he left for central Tibet, to take  up residence at the main seat at which every single Karmapa in history has  resided for some period: Tsurphu Monastery. </p>
                    <p >    
                        From Tsurphu, the Gyalwang Karmapa  travelled to Lhasa  to meet His Holiness the Thirteenth Dalai Lama, who performed a formal  hair-cutting ceremony for the Gyalwang Karmapa. During their first meeting, the  Karmapa wore his Action Crown. He removed the crown in order to perform the  traditional prostrations to the Dalai Lama. When the Sixteenth Karmapa had  completed his prostrations, His Holiness the Dalai Lama asked his chief  minister why the Karmapa had not removed his second hat to prostrate.  Astonished, the minister replied that the Gyalwang Karmapa had been completely  bare-headed. When the Dalai Lama explained that the Karmapa had only removed  the Action Crown, but not his other crown, all present realized that the  Thirteenth Dalai Lama had been able to perceive the Naturally Appearing Wisdom  Crown that all Karmapas bear, but only those of pure view actually perceive. In  1955, in his own next life as the Fourteenth, the Dalai Lama visited Tsurphu to  receive the Black Crown Ceremony from the Sixteenth Karmapa.</p>
                    <p >    
                        In the years to come, His Holiness  Rangjung Rigpe Dorje received the training traditionally undergone by each  Karmapa, performed the Black Crown Ceremony, and generally resumed his work of  ripening the minds of sentient beings. An account from the autobiography of  Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche gives a sense of His Holiness&rsquo; manner of  guiding disciples. Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche had been doing meditative  practice, mainly <em>ch&ouml;</em>, in a number of  caves and burial grounds in the vicinity of Tsurphu. When he sought an audience  with the Karmapa, he was granted a private interview at once.&nbsp; As Rinpoche relates in his autobiography:</p>
                    <p >    
                        &ldquo;What is the essence of your mind like?&rdquo;  [His Holiness the Sixteenth Karmapa] asked me. Immediately my mind became free  of thoughts, and, for a brief while, I could not speak. Eventually, I replied,  &ldquo;When I analyze my mind, I cannot find it, but, when it is resting, it  possesses clarity.&rdquo; He laughed and said, &ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s it. All objects are  appearance-emptiness inseparable. All mental states are clarity-emptiness  inseparable. All feelings are bliss-emptiness inseparable. This is how they  truly are; recognize them to be so.&rdquo; For a moment, through the guru&rsquo;s blessing,  my mind once again became free of thoughts, and I sat silently. He gazed upon  me and then said, &ldquo;Practice like that in the cave.&rdquo; I returned to my practice  cave once again, reflecting on the meaning of his words repeatedly. I gained  strong certainty that, although his words were brief, they possessed profound  and vast meaning. By contemplating these profound oral instructions, from the  time I received them to the present, I have come to understand that they  contain the profound, essential points of the view of all su&#772;tra and tantra.</p>

                    <h2>Into Exile</h2>

                    <p >
                        From His Holiness&rsquo; words and deeds while  in Tibet,  it is clear that he had a certain foreknowledge of the traumatic events to  come. At the age of 17, he had composed a poem that included this verse, as  translated in Michele Martin&rsquo;s <em>Music in  the Sky</em>:</p>
                    <p >
                        Not now, but on a distant tomorrow it  will be decided.</p>
                    <p >
                        Both the vulture and I know where to go.</br> 

                        The vulture soars into the depths of  space;</br>                
                        We people do not stay, but go to India.</br>                 
                        In the springtime a cuckoo comes as a  guest. </br>                
                        In the fall when the harvest ripens, it  knows where to go.</br> 
                        Its only thought is travel to the east of  India.</br> 

                    <p >
                        With remarkable prescience, His Holiness  began preparing for the flight from Tibet long in advance. During the  15 years before the communist Chinese invasion of Tibet, he made repeated pilgrimages  to countries whose hospitality would ensure the future of Tibetan Buddhism and  the Karma Kagyu lineage after Tibetans were forced into exile. The Gyalwang  Karmapa visited Bhutan in  1944, and made subsequent trips to Nepal  and India,  where he cultivated numerous important relationships. In Sikkim, he  built on the ties between the Karma Kagyu and the Sikkimese royalty that have  such deep roots in the history of the Karma Kagyu. Meanwhile, His Holiness  acted for the welfare of people within Tibet as well. In 1954, at the  invitation of the Chinese government, he accompanied His Holiness the  Fourteenth Dalai Lama and a number of other high officials on a trip to Beijing.</p>
                    <p >
                        Later, once the Chinese army began taking  over Tibet  by force, His Holiness continued to protect his disciples in ways that only  extraordinary masters can, as Khenpo Karthar Rinpoche relates in <em>Karma Chakme's Mountain Dharma as Taught by  Khenpo Karthar Rinpoche, Vol. Two</em>: </p>
                    <p >
                        When I was fleeing from the invading  communist army, I was being shot at by a machine gun. In order that I not be  killed, I was praying, &ldquo;<em>Karmapa khyenno,  Karmapa khyenno</em>,&rdquo; as I was running, and actually visualizing the Karmapa  covering my back. I managed to get away and was not hit by any of the bullets.  About a month after that, when I reached Central Tibet in Tsurphu, where His  Holiness was still living before he left Tibet, and a group of us had an  audience with him, he said, &ldquo;I am delighted that all of you were able to safely  escape from the invading soldiers, but I wish to remind some among you that you  are supposed to visualize your guru above your head, not on your back like some  kind of cape.&rdquo; </p>
                    <p >
                        In 1959, after repeated petitions from  his students to make his way to safety, His Holiness determined that the time  had come to leave Tibet.&nbsp; Travelling overland for 21 days, the Gyalwang  Karmapa and 160 of his disciples arrived safely in Bhutan, where the party was warmly  received by Bhutanese government officials. After discussions with the  Government of India as to where it would be best to resettle, and following the  eager invitation of the Sikkimese king, it was agreed that His Holiness would  establish a base for his lineage in Sikkim.&nbsp; Given his choice of land in the kingdom, His  Holiness selected a site in Rumtek where the Ninth Karmapa, Wangchuk Dorje, had  founded a monastic establishment in the 16th century. That monastery  had largely fallen into ruins, and was surrounded by dense jungle. The Indian  Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru generously offered the full support of the  Indian government for the planned construction. With land and further funds  provided by the Sikkimese royal house, in 1962 the daunting task of clearing  jungle and creating a new monastic seat commenced. During the rebuilding  effort, 108 monks and laypeople offered their service to the work 10 hours a  day. By 1966, His Holiness had entered his new seat in Rumtek, called  Dharmachakra Centre, and monastic life in exile could begin in earnest.</p>
                    <p >
                        Thereafter, during the 1960s and into the  1970s, an important focus of Gyalwang Karmapa&rsquo;s activities was training the  four major Karma Kagyu lineage holders: Shamar Rinpoche, Tai Situ Rinpoche,  Goshir Gyaltsap Rinpoche and Jamg&ouml;n Kongtrul Rinpoche. All four were at an  early stage of their study and training, and the Gyalwang Karmapa guided them  personally, as well as the remainder of the monastic community at Rumtek. </p>
                    <p >
                        His Holiness placed tremendous emphasis  on training in discipline, and the pure observance of monastic vows. He instituted  a remarkable practice in support of such training at the new monastery in  Rumtek. Each evening, the entire monastic assembly gathered for a detailed  review of the personal conduct of each member. His Holiness himself presided  over these nightly sessions, which were called <em>saldep</em>, meaning that guidance is given by reminding students of  what they already know. For between one and two hours, everyone was not only  permitted, but actively encouraged, to speak up about any infractions of  monastic discipline they had committed themselves or observed others commit.  The structure was entirely democratic, with ordinary monks fully authorized to  point out any lapses they had witnessed even by the highest of lamas present.  The system echoed the monastic training instituted by the Buddha himself,  wherein the correction and confession of physical and verbal misdeeds was  similarly conducted in an open forum. </p>
                    <p >
                        In the early years at Rumtek, such  sessions took place every day. Later in His Holiness&rsquo; life, they were held  three times a month. Under His Holiness&rsquo; watchful care, Rumtek Monastery gained  a reputation for maintaining exceptionally pure discipline. The results were  inspiring, and earned Rumtek Monastery the widespread respect of the local  Indian and Sikkimese communities.</p>

                    <h2>Turning to the West</h2>

                    <p >
                        Along with directing the re-establishment  of Tibetan Buddhism in exile in India,  a major deed of the Sixteenth Karmapa was his transmission of the Dharma to  countries of the West. Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, His Holiness made  numerous Dharma connections with Western students who came to see him in India. He  increasingly directed his energies towards the West in the mid-1970s, once his  community was established at his seat in India,  in Sikkim.  His Holiness made a first tour of Western countries in 1974, visiting the United States, Canada  and Europe. In 1975, he travelled to Rome to meet Pope Paul  VI. On a subsequent and far lengthier tour from 1976 to 1977, the Gyalwang  Karmapa met with other religious leaders, as well as important political and  cultural figures. </p>
                    <p >
                        In public, the Sixteenth Karmapa  performed the Black Crown Ceremony on numerous occasions across the West, and  conferred tantric initiation. Through these activities, His Holiness created  strong Dharma connections with the large assemblies who gathered for these  events. In private, he gave spiritual advice to the many students who sought  his counsel, directly guiding the meditative practice of Western disciples. In  this way, His Holiness&rsquo; activities both drew in new disciples seeking a  spiritual path, and ripened the minds of those who were already prepared to  commit themselves to serious Dharma practice.</p>
                    <p >
                        Throughout his activities, His Holiness  used a myriad means to collect his students and ripen their minds. Once, His  Holiness visited Samye Ling Dharma Centre in Scotland and taught at a local  village hall. A butterfly entered the hall and flew directly to His Holiness.  The Gyalwang Karmapa directed his gaze to it, and the butterfly then hovered  above his head motionless until the teaching had concluded. When His Holiness  rose and left, the butterfly also left. As the audience dispersed into the  night, they witnessed a rainbow-colored halo glowing around the moon. This  gentle outer sign of His Holiness&rsquo; inner qualities was clearly visible to all  present. When His Holiness was in Tibet, it was common for the public  to witness such signs as these, and other signs far more extraordinary.  However, because such verifiable displays of exceptional powers are rarely  perceived by skeptical Westerners, their impact in the West was all the  greater. </p>
                    <p >
                        His Holiness travelled in the early days  of the West&rsquo;s encounter with Tibetan lamas&mdash;from 1974 through 1981, well before  the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to His Holiness the Dalai Lama in 1989  put Tibet  on the cultural map. In many cases, Westerners did not know what to make of  this extraordinary being who inspired such obvious veneration and awe in  Tibetans, yet who walked amongst them with such joyful ease. But through his mere  presence and the teachings he gave with his every gesture,<strong> </strong>the Sixteenth Gyalwang Karmapa delivered the Dharma directly to  the hearts and minds of all he met&mdash;in life and in his exceptional death.<strong></strong></p>

                    <h2>The Final Stage</h2>

                    <p >    
                        It is generally explained that the principal  way that buddhas perform enlightened activity in the world is through  speech&mdash;public discourses, verbal explanations and oral instructions. His  Holiness certainly did teach in these ways, but one of the hallmarks of his  teaching was his ability to create experiences for others not only with his  speech, but with his body and mind as well. When the Sixteenth Karmapa neared  the end of his life, he elected to pass away in America. As he did, he used his  physical illness as a glorious and deeply transformative teaching for his  Western disciples as well as for the non-Buddhist medical staff who attended  him. </p>
                    <p >
                        The primary physician who attended His  Holiness, Dr. Mitchell Levy, created a record of the medical events surrounding  his passing away, seeking to make sense of the apparent discrepancies between  what was scientifically possible and the empirical evidence that the entire  medical staff was witness to. The following quotes are excerpted from that  report, as published in Reginald Ray&rsquo;s <em>Secret  of the Vajra World</em>. The doctor relates the first medical interview with his  &ldquo;patient,&rdquo; the Gyalwang Karmapa.</p>
                    <p >
                        At  the end, [His Holiness] said to me, &lsquo;There is one thing that is very important  for you to understand. If I am needed here to teach sentient beings, if I still  have work to do here, then no disease will ever be able to overcome me. And if  I am no longer really required to teach sentient beings, then you can tie me  down, and I will not stay on this earth.&rsquo; This was certainly an interesting way  to get introduced to one&rsquo;s patient&hellip;</p>
                    <p >
                        People  there &mdash; the hospital staff as well as visitors-were just completely overwhelmed  by him. Most of them were Christian, and none of them knew the first thing  about Buddhism, but they had no hesitancy whatever in calling him His Holiness.  They never once said, &lsquo;Karmapa,&rsquo; it was always &lsquo;His Holiness.&rsquo; The staff  couldn&rsquo;t stop talking about his compassion and about how kind he seemed. After  four or five days, the surgeon&mdash;a Filipino Christian&mdash; &hellip; kept saying to me, &lsquo;You  know, His Holiness is not an ordinary man. He really doesn&rsquo;t seem like an  ordinary person.&rsquo; Just the force of his will and his presence were so powerful,  that [everybody was] completely taken with it.</p>
                    <p >
                        &nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip; early on the day he actually died, we saw  that his monitor had changed. The electrical impulses through his heart had  altered in a way that indicated that it was starting to fail. And so we knew,  the surgeons knew, that something was imminent&hellip; </p>
                    <p >
                        &ldquo;Then  his heart stopped for about ten seconds. We resuscitated him, had a little  trouble with his blood pressure, brought it back up, and then he was stable for  about twenty-five minutes, thirty minutes, but it looked like he had had a  heart attack. Then his blood pressure dropped all the way down. We couldn&rsquo;t get  it back up at all with medication. And we kept working, giving him medication,  and then his heart stopped again. And so then we had to start pumping his chest  and then, at that point, I knew that this was it. Because you could just see  his heart dying in front of you on the monitor. But I felt that we needed to  demonstrate our thoroughness as much as we could, to reassure the  Rinpoches.&nbsp; So I kept the resuscitation going for almost forty-five  minutes, much longer than I normally would have. Finally, I gave him two amps  of intra-cardiac epinephrine and adrenaline and there was no response. Calcium.  No response. So we stopped and this was the point at which we finally gave up.  I went outside to make the call to Trungpa Rinpoche to tell him that His  Holiness had died. After that, I came back into the room, and people were  starting to leave. By this time, His Holiness had been lying there for maybe  fifteen minutes, and we started to take out the NG tube, and &hellip; all of a sudden  I look and his blood pressure is 140 over 80. And my first instinct, I shouted  out, &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s leaning on the pressure monitor?&rsquo; &hellip; Because I knew that for  pressure to go up like that, someone would have to be leaning on it with&hellip; well,  it wouldn&rsquo;t be possible.</p>
                    <p >
                        &ldquo;Then  a nurse almost literally screamed, &lsquo;He&rsquo;s got a good pulse! He&rsquo;s got a good  pulse!&rsquo;</p>
                    <p >
                        &hellip;  His Holiness&rsquo; heart rate was 80 and his blood pressure was 140 over 80, and  there was this moment in that room where I thought that I was going to pass  out. And no one said a word. There was literally a moment of &lsquo;This can&rsquo;t be.  This can&rsquo;t be.&rsquo; A lot had happened with His Holiness, but this was clearly the  most miraculous thing I had seen. &hellip; This was not just an extraordinary event.  This would have been an hour after his heart had stopped and fifteen minutes  after we had stopped doing anything&hellip;</p>
                    <p >
                        To  me, in that room, it had the feeling that His Holiness was coming back to check  one more time: could his body support his consciousness?&rsquo; &hellip; Just the force of  his consciousness coming back started the whole thing up again &mdash; I mean, this is  just my simple-minded impression, but this is what it actually felt like, in  that room.</p>
                    <p >
                        &ldquo;Shortly  after we left the room, the surgeon came out and said, &lsquo;He&rsquo;s warm. He&rsquo;s warm.&rsquo;  And then &hellip; the nursing staff was saying, &lsquo;Is he still warm?&rsquo; After all that had  happened, they just accepted it. As much as all that had happened might have  gone against their medical training, their cultural beliefs, and their  religious upbringing, by this point they had no trouble just accepting what was  actually occurring.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p >
                        His Holiness remained meditating in his  hospital bed for three days, and then moved on to take his rebirth as the  Seventeenth Karmapa. It was a mark of His Holiness&rsquo; wisdom and tremendous  kindness toward his Western disciples that he opted to display his death process  in a hospital in Chicago, USA. In the case of masters as  highly attained as the Karmapa, after their body apparently ceases functioning,  there are often external signs indicating that they are still in a meditative  state, controlling the transition to their next life. In Tibetan monasteries it  is customary to permit people to view such masters as they sit in post-mortem  meditation, their bodies still supple and fragrant. Seeing what serious  spiritual practice makes possible greatly enhances viewers&rsquo; faith, and also  demystifies the death process. For many Westerners, death is dreaded and  feared, and the possibility of understanding it as a positive opportunity seems  out of the question. Yet during what would have been a debilitating and painful  process for any ordinary person, His Holiness remained thoroughly focused on  the doctors, nurses and visitors surrounding him, and disinterested in the  details of his own physical condition. Choosing to remain in the hospital to  the end, the Gyalwang Karmapa&rsquo;s warmth and joy were thrown into relief against  the sterile clinical environment&mdash;vividly displaying the Buddhist truth that it  is the mind that determines our experiences, and not our bodies or outer  conditions. Enacting the Buddha&rsquo;s teachings even with his final breath, the  Sixteenth Gyalwang Karmapa was every bit as extraordinary in death as he was in  life.</p>
